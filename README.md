Welcome
---------
This is the 2.0 rewrite branch of Clutch.

This rewrite will be taking place over the next couple of months, so if you're a user this probably isn't the place you want to be (find the branch button and change it to 'master') - but if you want to test Clutch 2.0 then you're in the right place! Grab a copy and compile it, test it, break it, report the breaks. This project is _NOT_ production ready.

Any contributors - please submit pull requests! Any, even small, are appriciated. Please try to stick to the formatting we're using it makes everything easier to read. *Please* comment your code, if there are any weird hacks - *leave a note*. 

Any translators - we're not quite ready for you yet, when we are I will post about it. 


Any questions? Contact @NinjaLikesCheez on twitter for the 2.0 branch, I won't be dealing with 1.x.
